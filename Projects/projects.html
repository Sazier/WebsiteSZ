      <p>In this Module 231 also know as Datenschutz und Datensicherheit in german we learn the basics of using Data protection and data security in the Internet.
        This Module was so far my favourite module because the topic we discussed were very interesting. For example it was interesting to see what is happening with 
        our data and what different companies do with user or client data. We also learned  why it's really important to have different passwords for different accounts and that 
        we should use a passwordmanager. That were some of the topics of this module there are also other topics in this module for example backup's.

      <h2></h2>
      <p>Inside of the Module 117 (Informatik- und Netzinfrastruktur f√ºr ein kleines Unternehmen realisieren) we learned how to create a local network with different users and wifi.
        We first had to create a logical and a physical network plan for the company with the different devices and users. With those network plans we could than start writing 
        the prices of the material and service costs inside of the offer. After the offer was written every group had to create a IT concept and system documentation. Inside of this document 
        was the concept of the local network. After we were done with that we than had to create the local network with virtual machines.

      <h2></h2>
      <p>After the first two Modules were complete the module 162 (Daten analysieren und modellieren) has started. This module had four parts. The first part was about data and datastructures. 
        We learned what structured and unstructured data is, which types of characteristics and scales there are, different datatypes and datastructures. After we finished the first part  we started 
        the second part file formats. In this part we learned some JSON, dataformats and types and encoding. In the third part we learned how to import/export data in excel and how to create excel charts.
        The last part was about modeling data we looked at ERD / ERM's, datamodell types, relations, normalization and MySql Workbench. After the last part the module was completed.

      <h2></h2>
      <p>Parallel to M162 i also visited the Module 123 (Serverdienste in Betrieb nehmen). In this module we learned how to install and configure different servers in a local network.
        The first server we had to install and configure was the DHCP server. We first had to install and configure a DHCP server inside of Filius (learnsoftware) and than in Ubuntu. 
        After we were done with the DHCP server we had to install and configure a DNS server. We first had to install and configure it in filius and than in Windows.
        The next server we had to create was the Fileshare server, which we had to install and configure in Linux.
